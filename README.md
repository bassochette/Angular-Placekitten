##AngularJS Placekitten
###Because other place holders aren't as cute

Have you ever needed an image placeholder in your AngularJS application?

Have ever wished said placeholders were cuter to look at?

Well you're in luck because Placekitten not only makes variable sized image placeholders, it fills them with kittens!

####Installation
 
 Use bower to install:
 
  ```bash
  bower install angular-placekitten
  ```

####Usage
    
  Use the kitten directive to insert a place holder.
  
    <kitten></kitten>
    
  Use the optional height and width parameters to adjust the size of the placeholder.
  
    <kitten height="500" width="700"></kitten>
  
  Note: 400px is the default width and 500px is the default height.
